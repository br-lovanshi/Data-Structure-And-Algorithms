## 📂 **Topics**

### 📍 Binary Search  
- [ ] **Status:** _In Progress / Completed_
- 📌 **Priority:** High
- **What is Binary Search?**  
  Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.
- **Approach:**  
  - Find the middle element.
  - If the target is equal to the middle element, return the index.
  - If the target is smaller, search the left half.
  - If the target is larger, search the right half.
  - Repeat this process until the search space is exhausted.
- **When to Use?**  
  - When the array is **sorted**.
  - When you need a logarithmic time complexity solution.
- **Time Complexity:**  
  - **Best case:** O(1)  
  - **Worst & Average case:** O(log n)
- **Solved Problems:**

### 📍 Kadane's Algorithm
- [ ] **Status:** _In Progress / Completed_
- 📌 **Priority:** High
- **What is Kadane's Algorithm?**  
  Kadane's Algorithm is used to find the maximum sum subarray in an array using a dynamic approach.
- **Approach:**  
  - Initialize `max_sum` and `current_sum` as the first element.
  - Iterate through the array and update `current_sum` by adding the current element or starting fresh.
  - Update `max_sum` whenever `current_sum` is higher.
- **When to Use?**  
  - When finding the largest sum of contiguous elements.
- **Time Complexity:**  
  - O(n)
- **Solved Problems:**  
  - [ ] [Leetcode 53: Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

### 📍 2D Arrays
- [ ] **Status:** _In Progress / Completed_
- 📌 **Priority:** Medium
- **What are 2D Arrays?**  
  2D arrays are arrays where each element is itself an array, forming a matrix-like structure.
- **Approach:**  
  - Iterating using nested loops.
  - Common operations: searching, transposing, rotating.
- **When to Use?**  
  - When dealing with matrices or grids.
- **Time Complexity:**  
  - Varies based on operation.
- **Solved Problems:**  
  - [ ] [Leetcode 240: Search a 2D Matrix II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/)
